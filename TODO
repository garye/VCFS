- Fix bugs, general cleanup (obviously)

- Fix Makefile (dependencies aren't quite right. Should force rebuild when .c/.h files change)

- Enhancements to cvstool:
  cvstool should be able to handle relative paths
  cvstool should accept the "long" format of flags ("-l" or "--long")
  ct lsver -l with log messages
  ct lsver -f (from some particular version, or maybe just how many to show)
  ct diff
  ct update (change version of a file)

- Delete least-recently used "extended-name" files from cache (README,1.3 etc.)

- Multi-file cache

- Better error-handling throughout

- Read .cvspass file if available to get password instead of always asking

- Webpage:
  Expand description. Add feature list, possible enhancements.
  Add links to related projects, things like CVS resources.
