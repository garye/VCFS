Warning:
This software is in the early stages of development. Please use with caution.

Installation:
Running 'make' gives you two executables, 'vcfsd' and 'cvstool'.

Requirements:
This package has only been tested on one Mandrake Linux x86 machine, running kernel
2.2.17. Your mileage may vary.

You must have 'rpc.mountd' or another version of the mount protocol installed on your
system. You also must have root privilegas on the installation machine.

You will need a directory to export in order to bootstrap a "root" filehandle for
your NFS client to start with. For maximum security, export an empty directory with
no permissions.

Example:
mkdir /null
chmod 0 /null

Next, you will need to create the actual vcfs mount point (mkdir /vcfs).
In order for cvstool to work, set the environment variable VCFS_MOUNT to this
directory.
Add the mount point to your /etc/exports file (add the line "/null localhost") 
to export the boostraped mount point to the local machine.

Now start the vcfsd daemon to connect to a CVS repository.

Finally, as root, make sure the mount daemon is running ('rpc.mountd' on my system),
and mount the filesystem with the command 'mount -o port=3155,intr localhost:/null /vcfs'
'cd' to /vcfs to view your repository.

I learned a great deal from Matt Blaze's CFS, who's ideas vcfs borrows heavily from.
