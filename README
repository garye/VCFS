              ***** Readme for VCFS test release 0.1 *****

Warning: 
This software is in the early stages of development. Please
use with caution, and report bugs through http://sourceforge.net/projects/vcfs
or send email to endgame00@users.sourceforge.net 

Requirements:
This package has only been tested on one Mandrake Linux x86 machine,
running kernel 2.2.17. Your mileage may vary. If you run into any
problems on any platforms, please let us know.
You also must have NFS running on your system, which usually includes
the following daemons:
- rpc.mountd
- rpc.portmap
- rpc.nfsd

Installation:
Running 'make' gives you two executables, 'vcfsd' and 'cvstool'.

You will need a directory to export in order to bootstrap a "root" 
directory filehandle for your NFS client to start with. For maximum security, 
export an empty directory with no permissions.

Example (as root):
mkdir /null
chmod 0 /null

Next, you will need to create the actual vcfs mount point (mkdir /vcfs).
In order for cvstool to work, set the environment variable VCFS_MOUNT to this
directory.
Add the mount point to your /etc/exports file (add the line "/null localhost") 
to export the bootstrap mount.

Now, start the vcfsd daemon to load a CVS repository. 
Example:
vcfsd cvs.vcfs.sourceforge.net /cvsroot/vcfs vcfs anonymous

There is no password for this project. You can also run the
"load_vcfs" script found in the "examples" subdirectory of the VCFS
distribution. 

Finally, make sure the mount daemon is running. 
('rpc.mountd' as root on my system), and mount the filesystem 
with the following command:
mount -o port=3155,intr localhost:/null /vcfs

You can also run the "mount_vcfs" script found in the "examples" 
subdirectory of the VCFS distribution.

You can now 'cd' to /vcfs to view your repository.
